Researchers designed one system that classified interactive and noninteractive processes automatically by looking at the amount of terminal I/O. If a process did not input or output to the terminal in a 1-second interval, the process was classified as noninteractive and was moved to a lower-priority queue. In response to this policy, one programmer modified his programs to write an arbitrary character to the terminal at regular intervals of less than 1 second. The system gave his programs a high priority, even though the terminal output was completely meaningless. Solution:- If we consider this question here it says that if we are going to give priority to the smallest process, definitely each and every programmer is going to do that he will manage all larger process into small. In this way when we are going to to give priority to the process of Non-interactive, then the programmer that means we will definitely going to use interactive. This means whenever we are going to shift from one environment to another definitely there is a chance of  code will become change and a loads of difficulties which we should going to face.
